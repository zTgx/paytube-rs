//! PayTube. A simple SPL payment channel.
//!
//! PayTube is an SVM-based payment channel that allows two parties to exchange
//! tokens off-chain. The channel is opened by invoking the PayTube "VM",
//! running on some arbitrary server(s). When transacting has concluded, the
//! channel is closed by submitting the final payment ledger to Solana.
//!
//! The final ledger tracks debits and credits to all registered token accounts
//! or system accounts (native SOL) during the lifetime of a channel. It is
//! then used to to craft a batch of transactions to submit to the settlement
//! chain (Solana).
//!
//! Users opt-in to using a PayTube channel by "registering" their token
//! accounts to the channel. This is done by delegating a token account to the
//! PayTube on-chain program on Solana. This delegation is temporary, and
//! released immediately after channel settlement.
//!
//! Note: This opt-in solution is for demonstration purposes only.

//! The Solana SVM's `TransactionBatchProcessor` requires projects to provide a
//! "loader" plugin, which implements the `TransactionProcessingCallback`
//! interface.
//!
//! PayTube defines a `PayTubeAccountLoader` that implements the
//! `TransactionProcessingCallback` interface, and provides it to the
//! `TransactionBatchProcessor` to process PayTube transactions.
